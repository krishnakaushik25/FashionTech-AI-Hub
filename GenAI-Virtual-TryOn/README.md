# GenAI Virtual Try-On Clothes Platform

**A next-generation solution for virtual apparel try-on, powered by generative AI and modern web technologies.**

---

## Overview

This project introduces a web-based system that enables users to preview how clothing items would look on different models using advanced generative techniques. By uploading any model photo and garment image, the platform creates lifelike composite results in real-time. The solution is suitable for integration with fashion, retail, and e-commerce experiences.

## Core Highlights

- **AI-Driven Visualization:** Generate realistic try-on images that simulate garment fit across various body types.
- **Rapid Feedback Loop:** Users can instantly see how an outfit appears without physical trials.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Built with React for a seamless browsing and upload experience.
- **Efficient Data Processing:** FastAPI handles backend requests for swift, scalable image generation.
- **E-Commerce Compatibility:** Designed for straightforward plug-in to online retail platforms.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Project**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/Gen-AI-Virtual-Try-On-Clothes.git
   cd Gen-AI-Virtual-Try-On-Clothes
   ```

2. **Backend Configuration**
   - Go to the backend directory.
   - Install the Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Launch the FastAPI server:
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```

3. **Frontend Configuration**
   - Switch to the frontend directory.
   - Install the Node.js packages:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the React development server:
